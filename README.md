Description

This assignment requires you to implement a Binary Search Tree to be used as a map data structure with a few additional operations. In addition, you are also asked to implement a Array Based Heap and modify a BST, both to be used as a Priority Queue. The assignment will only have a single mandatory phase, assigned right now. A bonus phase will follow soon.

You are going to implement the binary search tree which implements a binary search tree interface and a map interface. You are also given an adaptable priority queue interface. This is going to be implemented by an array-based heap and a binary search tree based priority queue, which also extends the previous binary search tree. The details of these interfaces will not be given here due to the comments in the files. Feel free to contact us if anything is unclear. You are additionally given additional classes that will help with the implementation.

As mentioned above, yhe code has comments about the assignment and the desired functionality. Majority of what you need to do is actually in these comments so make sure you read them carefully. You are provided with a compressed file which contains following files. Bold ones are the ones you need to modify and they are placed under the code folder, with the rest under given.

<ul>
<li>iMap.java: This file defines a simple map interface. Even though you do not need to modify this, make sure you read the comments in detail. It is pretty straight forward.</li>
<li>iBinarySearchTree.java: This file includes the iBinaryTree interface, which describes the desired binary search tree ADT. Even though you do not need to modify this, make sure you read the comments in detail.</li>
<li>Entry.java: This file includes the Entry class that describes a Key-Value pair. Certain useful methods are implemented for you. This will form the basis of your binary tree nodes and be used in the priority queues. You should take a look at its functions but do not modify it.</li>
<li>BinaryTreeNode.java: This file includes the BinaryTreeNode class which is used in the binary tree as nodes. It extends the Entry class. You are free to design and implement it however you want.</li>
<li>BinarySearchTree.java: This is where one of the main data structures of the assignment, the BinarySearchTree class, should be implemented. It extends both the iBinarySearchTree and the iMap interfaces. You should implement this class and the BinaryTreeNode class in conjunction.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>DefaultComparator.java: This file implements the comparators that are used in the assignment. You do not need to touch this or even go over this unless you are curious.</li>
<li>TestBST.java: A very simple program to test your binary search tree implementation. It is designed to be resemble a primitive autograder. We might update this!.</li>
<li>iAdaptablePriorityQueue.java: This file includes the iAdaptablePriorityQueue interface, which describes an adaptable priority queue interface. As with the other interface files, make sure to go over the comments. There is one important point, its operations assume that both the keys and the values are unique. This is done to make the assignment easier but it is not very realistic. If you ever need something ike this in rel life, keep this in mind! Another point is that the adaptations require you to find the right entries. This is slightly different than the Position concept we have seen, i.e., to change keys or values we find the relevant entry but do not store indiviual entries.</li>
<li>BSTBasedPQ.java: This file defines the binary search tree based priority queue, namely the BSTBasedPQ class. It extends the BinarySearchTree class and implements the iAdaptablePriorityQueue interface. Do not try to create heap behavior but think about how to use a BST as a priority queue.

Hint: There is a O(log(n)) way to get to the minimum element!</li>
<li>ArrayBasedHeap.java: This is where the other main data structures of the assignment, the ArrayBasedHeap class, should be implemented. It extendsthe iAdaptablePriorityQueue inter- face. We suggest that you first implement the array based binary tree functionality (no interface given but you can get inspiration from the available interfaces/classes), then add heap functionality. Make sure that this actually behaves as a heap and not a sorted list!</li>
<li>testPQ.java: An implementation of an order-book based on your priority queue implementations. Feel free to ask about its implementation in person but we are not going to delve into it here. However, you can change the testFolderName variable to make the problem bigger. I have provided an excel sheet to help you compare your outputs with the desired ones. Everything should be self- explanatory but feel free to ask if needed.
Warning: The not implemented yet warnings are removed since it confused some of you. However, this means that it is up to you to make sure everything is implemented and not left empty!

Hint: If certain operations end up being O(n), it is fine! Bonus

You are asked to implement a phone book in the bonus part of the assignment. The phone book stores contact information and is efficiently searchable (In this context, efficient means not iterating over all the entries!) using two keys, contact name and contact number. In addition, it should be searchable by e-mail (not necessarily efficiently). We have gone over how to do it in the class on April 2nd by using multiple maps. You are only allowed to use your own tree implementations in this bonus part!. My suggestion is for you to use two binary search trees, one for the contact name and the other for the contact number. All the rest are in the comments. The added files are:
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ContactInfo.java: This file has the ContactInfo class that you should store as your values. You do not need to touch this but should go over it.</li>
<li>PhoneBook.java: This file includes the PhoneBook class which you need to complete based on the description here and the comments in the file. To make things easier, you can assume that the name and numbers will be unique. Note that we have gone over how to handle non-unique keys in April 2ndâ€™s class. Other than only being allowed to use your own tree data structures, feel free to implement this class in any way you want.</li>
<li>TestPhoneBook.java: The file containing the main function to test your phone-book implementa- tion. We are not going to delve into it here and you will need to figure out how it works if needed. We have provided a text file named bonus output.txt to help you compare. Feel free to create your own test files if the given ones are too big and complex to start with.
The input files for both testing the phonebook and the priority queues are generated randomly, based on certain rules. We have used you a mix of your names and surnames for the phonebook and created random phone numbers, e-mails and addresses. Please do not take any of the resulting names seriously.
